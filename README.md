# libft
The first algorithm project to create a library of functions in C. 
The aim of this project is to recode the standard C library functions.

## objective
C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to those highly useful standard functions. 

This project makes you to take the time to re-write those functions, understand them, and learn to use them. This library will help you for all your future C projects.
Through this project, we also give you the opportunity to expand the list of functions with your own.
